# Virtual Stock Trader

This application was created for our Application Development 1 class.

It was created using Windows Forms and the .NET Framework.

The application allows the user to practice buying and selling real stocks with virtual currency, and track their gains or losses over time. It is perfect for somebody new to stock trading who would like to get a feel for the way it works. By default the user starts with $100,000, which could be changed in the application settings.
